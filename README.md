## Swagger
In the process of configuring, I encountered the problem of conflicts between ui and swagger core.
The solution is suggested in git:(https://github.com/springfox/springfox#migrating-from-earlier-snapshot &
https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/3360).

Open Swagger API - `http://{host}:{port}/swagger-ui/index.html`
